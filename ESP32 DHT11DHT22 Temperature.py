# Project 6: DHT11/DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
# Description: Reads temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor
#              and prints it to the REPL.

# Hardware: ESP32, DHT11/DHT22 sensor, jumper wires.
# Connection: DHT Data pin to ESP32 GPIO (e.g., GPIO4), VCC to 3.3V, GND to GND.
# Library: Requires 'dht.py' library.
#          You need to upload 'dht.py' to your ESP32's filesystem first.
#          Find dht.py here: https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/umodules/dht/dht.py

# Initialize the DHT sensor object
# For DHT11: sensor = dht.DHT11(Pin(DHT_PIN))
# For DHT22: sensor = dht.DHT22(Pin(DHT_PIN))
sensor = dht.DHT22(Pin(DHT_PIN)) # Using DHT22 for better accuracy
